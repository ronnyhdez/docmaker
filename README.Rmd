## Overview

`docmaker` is a package that allows you to automate your workflow for taking
notes or creating documentation and publish it as a webpage using GitHub pages,
MkDocs, and Rmarkdown or Quarto or Markdown.

If you have a repository with files built with Rmarkdown/Quarto/Markdown that you 
would like to take to MkDocs; `docmaker` will help you with the all the steps
in the middle to achieve this.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `docmaker` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ronnyhdez/docmaker")
```

If you don´t have the `devtools` package installed, run the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

## Usage

You can create your repository on GitHub, clone your repo and from there, you
will need to implement a structure to be able to use GitHub pages and MkDocs. 
For this you can use the function:

```{r build_repo example, eval = FALSE}
library(docmaker)
build_repo(github_page_url = "https://ronnyhdez.github.io/drawer/",
           site_author = "Ronny A. Hernández Mora")
```

Once you have a repository, you can take your Rmarkdown/Quarto/Markdown notes
and deploy them with GitHub pages

```{r make_doc example, eval = FALSE}
make_doc(file = "check.Rmd", mkdocs_build = TRUE, mkdocs_deploy = TRUE)
```

If you have several files in the root of your project directory, you can instead
use the following function to build and deploy all your Rmd files:

```{r make_all_docs example, eval  = FALSE}
make_all_docs(deploy = TRUE)
```

In the case of having `md` files, you can use the following function to update
them in the folder that is deployed to GitHub pages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
update_md_files("~/Desktop/test_docmaker")
```

If a file is no longer needed, and you erase that file from your root directory,
it will needed to update the `docs/` folder. In that case we can use the 
function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
clean_files()
```
