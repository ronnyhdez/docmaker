\description{
Take all your Rmarkdown documents and render to markdown. This
function also can deploy all your content at once to your GitHub site.
}
\details{
The function assumes that all your Rmd files are located in the
root of your directory. Every file that is \strong{Rmd} will be rendered to md
and then build with mkdocs followed by the deployment action if param
\code{deploy} is TRUE.

If you are using your README file as .Rmd, this function will ignore this
file.
